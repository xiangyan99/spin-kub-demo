# Sample webserver for Spinnaker codelab

Source to prod Kubernetes Spinnaker artifact code is staged here. The point is to provide a simple webserver that can have its colors/content quickly tweaked during a demo or tutorial.

This specific fork of the 'spin-kub-demo' repository is used in the [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://aka.ms/azspinnaker).
